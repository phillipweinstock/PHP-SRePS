Hi my name is phillip, I am here today to represent our
StartUp company Idle.IT

INNOVATION THROUGH AUTOMATION

Our Vision, is to encourage growers and prospective growers who wish to have low maintenice, high yield hydroponic micro crops.
We discovered a gap in the market when my peer and I noticed how much time was consumed looking after hydroponic plants, He was unable to leave the house for more than a day and was essentially a prisoner of his plants, because his tomato plants would die without his continueos attention.
We thought to ourselfs why do we need to spend so much time maintaining plants.
The point of hydroponics is to have good crops, In our busy today lives, there is little spare time.

Very few people have the luxury of time, but this should not stop people from making their own produce, food is purchased because of the time constraints placed on us, but this should not be the case, that is our mission statment.

Currently our team consists of
A Citizen scientist,
An Apprentice machinist 
and a programmer.

Because of the multidisplinary nature of our team, we have approched the problem from multiple viewpoints, this has allowed us to propose this solution to you today.

the solution we came up with is to automate it, With idle it, A platform to do  the tasks that you can do with a idle mind, without the mind, so you can focus your time on what matters most.
